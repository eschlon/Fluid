Fluid is a light-weight, hackable pen & paper RPG system designed primarily to provide a flexible and extensible foundation for the kinds of games I like to run. It is not designed to be suitable for everyone or for every situation, however it is designed to be flexible, easy to pick up and easy to hack on.

''Goals not Tasks''

Fluid is a goal-based system as opposed to a task-based system. You don’t roll to pick the lock, you roll to open the door quietly.

''Actions are Actions''

Fluid doesn’t discriminate between different types of activities. There is no fundamental difference between a combat and a debate.

''The Dice Don’t Lie''

There’s no fudging in Fluid. If a decision comes down to a die roll, then the dice are rolled and the result stands. Both the Player(s) and the GM are bound by these results.

''Collaboration over Competition''

In Fluid the players and the game master are collaborators in building the narrative and shaping the world, not competitors trying to beat each other.

''Fluid is Flexible''

The core mechanics are flexible and composable into a system fits the scene and the narrative. The mechanics can scale to add suspense and detail when needed, or get out of the way and let the scene flow naturally.

''Fluid is Layered''

Fluid is composed of a set of core primitives and mechanics called [[Fluid Source]] that defines the system foundation. Source provides a simple, complete ruleset that can be used on its own, or as a framework to build on. Additional enrichment is provided by [[▽ Fluid Droplets]], which provide additional systems, talents, and tables.

If this seems interesting, head over and take a look at [[Fluid Source]] first, to learn about the foundation of the system.
