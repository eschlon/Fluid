title: Bonuses & Penalties
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Talents and other mechanics can modify nearly every aspect of a test, both positively and negatively. These modifiers are often denoted with a bit of notation.

!! Pool Modifiers $$(\pm Nd)$$
Many talents provide their bonuses as extra dice in specific situations, and the GM may impose penalties to your pool based on the narrative context (e.g. attempting to pick a lock while balanced on a slippery ledge over a pit of lava).

!! Success Modifiers $$(+ Ns)$$
Some talents will provide their bonus as raw successes. There is no equivalent penalty, as successes are never directly penalized. 

!! Threshold Modfiers $$(\pm Nt)$$
The threshold of a given test can be modified direclty and/or via //Advantage// and //Disadvantage//. By convention, positive values are beneficial (e.g. $$+1t$$ lowers your threshold to 5) and negative values are detrimental (e.g. $$-1t$$ raises your threshold to 7).

//Advantage// and //Disadvantage// are categorical and exclusive.

* If you have one or more relevant masteries or traits you are //Advantaged//, granting a $$+1t$$ bonus.
* If you have one or more opposing traits you are //Disadvantaged//, imposing a $$-1t$$ penalty.
* If you have both relevant masteries/traits and opposing traits you're neutral and get no bonus or penalty.

In any case, direct modifiers applied by other //Talents// are applied independently and can stack with modifiers for //Advantage// or //Disadvantage//. Talents which set the threshold directly (e.g. //set threshold to 4//) supercede and ignore //Advantage// and //Disadvantage// entirely.

!! Pips $$(+ Np)$$
Pips are the names for the dots on casino style dice, and thatâ€™s exactly what they represent. A single pip can be used to raise the face value of any one die by one point. If you have pips just take the highest non-success, spend pips to make it a success and then move on to the next highest and repeat until you either have all successes or run out of pips. //Boons// granted by equipment are the standard way of gaining pips, though some //Talents// also provide pips.

Lukas spends the afternoon attempting to convince the local milita that the Mayor's son is actually the one behind the recent murder spree. He decides to use his 4 //Empathy// and 4 //Persuasion// in the attempt giving him a base die pool of 8. The GM imposes a -1d penalty to the roll, as the milita lieutenant is paid by the Mayor; however Lukas's //Brutally Honest// trait gives him a +1t bonus and the group decides that his accumulated evidence is pretty damning, worth 5 pips. Lukas rolls 7 dice with a threshold of 5 and gets [10, 9, 9, 5, 3, 3, 1], four natrual successes. He then uses four of his five his pips to upgrade his the two 3's to 5's resulting in a total of 7 successes for the test.
