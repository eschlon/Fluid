Your extensive armor training has made you adept at putting things between you and physical harm. Pay ''1x Armor'', for the remiander of the scene if you can narrate how you are using any item -- a weapon, a barstool, a beer stein -- to defend yourself that item is considered to be [[♦ Sturdy]].  Items with no defined quality are considered destroyed by using the property.
