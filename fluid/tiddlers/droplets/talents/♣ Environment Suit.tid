Your ability to survive hostile environments is legendary. Whenever you are faced with a hostile environmental condition: a disease infested swamp, a volcanic mountain, a searing desert, a frozen mountain peak... you may spend ''1x Stamina'' and narrate how you intend to navigate the hostile elements. Depending on the nature of your narration the you may either be able to enter immediately or construct equipment to allow safe passage.
