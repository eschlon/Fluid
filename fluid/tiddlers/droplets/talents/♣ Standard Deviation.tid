Your scholarly activities have taught you how to always perform ahead of the curve. Pay ''1x Scholarship'' and spend additional time to complete any mental action, taking time to study the problem and devise a strategy. Instead of rolling take a number of successes equal to half the dice in the die pool (rounded up, of course) plus one.
