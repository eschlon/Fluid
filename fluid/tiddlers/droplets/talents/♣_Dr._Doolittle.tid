Your training has made you adept at both making and identifying animal calls. Upon hearing a call you may pay ''1x Taming'' to immediately identify the animal that it came from, as well as the direction and general mood of the creature that made it. You can also make animal calls that are virtually indistinguishable from the real thing.
