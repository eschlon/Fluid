Accomplishing one's goals is the best motivator. Narrate a sequence of goals or actions that you wish to perform in the immediate future. If you succeed at the first action you may pay ''1x Labor'' to gain a $$+1s$$ bonus to the next action in the sequence. You may continue to pay ''1x Labor'' to get a cumulative $$+1s$$ bonus on subsequent actions until you run out of //Labor//, break from the originally narrated plan, or fail an action in the sequence.
