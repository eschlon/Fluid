You're pretty good at getting what you want. Pay ''1x Crime'' to add your //Crime// as bonus dice to a //Resources// attempt. Items obtained in this way are assumed to be from the black-market, stolen or otherwise illegal. Note that using //Crime// in this way may result in extremely nasty consequences if the attempt fails.
