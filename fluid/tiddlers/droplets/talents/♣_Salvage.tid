The world is a treasure trove of valuable and useful things, and you are always on the lookout for things that might be useful. You may pay ''1x Exploration'' and narrate a plausible story about how you came to obtain some natural item (e.g. I picked up this raw iron ore when we were travelling through the dwarven kingdoms) to obtain that item.
