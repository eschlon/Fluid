Your extensive unarmed training has made you adept at getting out of the way of things that mean you physical harm. Pay ''1x Unarmed'', for the remiander of the scene if you can narrate how you are using any item -- a cloak, a feather duster, a loose fitting shirt -- to defend yourself that item is considered to be [[♦ Concealing]].  Items with no defined quality are considered destroyed by using the property.
