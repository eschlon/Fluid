Whenever you successfully craft a given item you may pay ''1x Labor'' to immediately craft another. Note that this does not avoid the time it takes to craft the second item (e.g. If you spent 1 week crafting the first, you would spend 1 week crafting the second), and you must have sufficient materials (if you used up all your //Dragon Bone// the first time you're out of luck).
