Alchemists acquire and invent formulae to produce potions, salves, oils, powders and other chemicals that have magical properties. Formulae always require three components: a chemical base, a catalyzing reagent and a container to keep the chemical inert and preserved until use. 

This talent allows the Alchemist to invent formulae, fabricate esoteric items from their formulae and utilize alchemical equipment and materials to enhance their tests. They may also narrate a catalyst, in addition to any required materials. This catalyst provides a bonus equal to its quality based on the following guidelines:
